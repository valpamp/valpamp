- I’m @valpamp, PhD candidate in Energy and Environment at la Sapienza University
- I'm a Space Engineer and most of my work revolves aroud satellite image analysis 🛰️
- My main research fields are wildfire management :fire:, vegetation monitoring 🌳, on-orbit image sharpness assessment 🔍 and shoreline mapping 🏖️
- As you can guess, my coding skills revolve mostly around data science and image analysis
- I've got a lot of experience in Matlab and Python, but I've switched to the latter for most of my projects
- I've studied a little C and C++ and would like to get to know them better
- I secretly wish achieve this by building something like OpenLara for my favourite Pysgnosis games, but don't tell anyone
